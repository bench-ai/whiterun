<strong>Generate a new image from a text prompt using SDXL as the model</strong>
<br>
<br><Strong>Sampler - </Strong>Determines patterns used to generate the image. Each sampler outputs a different quality at varying speeds so experimentation is needed.
<br><Strong>Steps - </Strong>How many diffusion steps to run, more steps means more quality but longer time to generate.
<br><Strong>Guidance - </Strong>How closely the model follows the given prompt when generating the image, lower
values mean higher creativity while higher values require more detailed prompts. A good range is between 5 and 12.
<br><Strong>Seed - </Strong>Value determines noise seed, leave the same if you want to generate the same image
given the same prompt, otherwise we recommend leaving it as 0 for a random seed.

<strong>Unique Settings for Image to Image Mode</strong>
<br><Strong>Image Strength - </Strong>How much influence the input image has on the process. Higher values result in images closer to the original image.
