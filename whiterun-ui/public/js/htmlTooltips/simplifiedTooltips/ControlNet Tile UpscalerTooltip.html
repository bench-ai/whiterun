<strong>Upscale an image to a higher resolution and outputs it</strong>
<br>
<br><Strong>Sampler - </Strong>Determines patterns used to generate the image. Each sampler outputs a different quality at varying speeds so experimentation is needed.
<br><Strong>Resolution - </Strong>Determines resolution to upscale the original image to.
<br><Strong>Base Image Resemblance - </Strong>How close the upscaled image should look to the original input image.
<br><Strong>Guidance - </Strong>How closely to follow the prompt.
<br><Strong>HDR - </Strong>How much to improve the HDR over the original image.
<br><Strong>Creativity - </Strong>How creative the model can be when upscaling the image.
<br><Strong>Seed - </Strong>Value determines noise seed, leave the same if you want to generate the same image
given the same prompt, otherwise we recommend leaving it as 0 for a random seed.
<br><Strong>Steps - </Strong>How many diffusion steps to run, more steps means more quality but longer time to generate.
<br><Strong>Guess Mode - </Strong>Tries to upscale the image based on the content of the image. Ignores all input prompts.
Guidance scale between 3 and 5 is recommended when this option is enabled.
